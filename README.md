# Face-detection-using-Haar-cascade

Face detection can be regarded as a specific case of object-class detection.

In object-class detection, the task is to find the locations and sizes of all objects in an image that belong to a given class. 

Examples include upper torsos, pedestrians, and cars.
Face-detection algorithms focus on the detection of frontal human faces.

It is analogous to image detection in which the image of a person is matched bit by bit. Image matches with the image stored in the database.

Any facial feature changes in the database will invalidate the matching process.
